# Paradigms

There are three main programming paradigms that can be used in *Hush*: procedural, functional, and object oriented programming. As the language has functions, statements and basic flow control, procedural programming comes pretty naturally. For functional programming, the support for first class and higher order functions are the core features that enable usage of such paradigm. As for object oriented programming, the language provides basic mechanisms for defining objects with fields and methods.

In the following sections, we'll explore examples on how to use functional and object oriented programming in *Hush*.
