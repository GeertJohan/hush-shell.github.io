# Wrapping up

This was an all around quick tutorial on *Hush*, a modern shell programming language. We hope that it has enabled you to write and maintain robust shell scripts, and that the language proves itself to be a solid tool for system and infrastructure programming. If you have any criticism, suggestions, or want to contribute to the project, feel free to reach us out on [Github](https://github.com/hush-shell/hush).
